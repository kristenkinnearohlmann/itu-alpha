# Visual ITU Alphabet

Amateur (ham) radio operators need to know their ITU alphabet to communicate appropriately. Over the past decade, I have found I can imperfectly recall the proper words for each letter. This resource helps people remember the letter by including an image to associate with the word.

If you have been looking for a source that helps you better learn and remember the ITU alphabet for use in ham radio operations - it's here!

Dedicated to Dad (KD0NPJ) and Leah L, whose dad talks to her in ITU letters.
